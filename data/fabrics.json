    "information": "High quality and long wearing fabric widely considered sustaimable, but the production of silk has a mixed impact. It is a natural fibre and will biodegrade, Mulberry trees that sustain silkworms require few pesticides or fertilisers, and it can be grown organically. However, there are concern surrounding a high use of fossil fuels, animal welfare rights and the welfareof workers producing silk. Silk items are great to build a long wearing, sustainable wardrobe but to minimise impact, look for Fair Trade, organic silk where possible."
