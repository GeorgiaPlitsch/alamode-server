    "name": "Silk",
    "information": "Silk comes from the cocoons of silkworms -it's a luxorious, high quality and long wearing fabric widely considered sustaimable, but the production of silk does have a mixed impact. It is a natural fibre and will biodegrade, Mulberry trees that sustain silkworms require few pesticides or fertilisers, and it can be grown organically and require less water than cotton. However, there are concern surrounding a high use of fossil fuels, animal welfare rights and the welfareof workers producing silk. Silk items are great to build a long wearing, sustainable wardrobe but to minimise impact, look for Fair Trade, organic silk where possible."

A high quality, long wearing fabric so can be intergrated into a conscious, slow fashion wardrobe. However, the process of manufacturing viscoce uses harsh, damaging chemicals and viscose takes 20-200 years to fully bio-degrade. Where possible we reccommend looking for Lyocell as an alternative, a type of viscose with an eco-friendly manufacturing process"
